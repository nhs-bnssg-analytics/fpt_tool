# planner 0.1.1 (2024-08-14)

* Fixed bug for models that were modelling the change in value from the previous year.
* Simplified some of the variables, so there are fewer inputs

  * Day and night beds have been combined for the bed occupancy metric as well as the beds per 60+ population
  * Clinical workforce FTEs have been combined into a "Total" metric rather than having the individual staff groups
