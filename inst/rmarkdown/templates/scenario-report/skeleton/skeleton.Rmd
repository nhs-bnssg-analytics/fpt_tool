This report was built with version xxx of the tool.

## Introduction

This report contains charts developed using models built on public data. The models attempt to predict NHS performance metrics for demand and capacity metrics from within the public health and health care setting. Models were selected using a data driven process, which identified which inputs are most influetial on the performance metrics.

More information on the models and their development can be found [here](https://nhs-bnssg-analytics.github.io/d_and_c/outputs/01_index.html).

## Scenario tool

An RShiny tool has been developed that applies the models to future data. The user can provide the tool different scenarios for inputs in future years, and then applying the underpinning models to those inputs it predicts future performance. 

## Future performance

The charts below have been generated using the tool described. The historic observed values have been included to provide the reader with information on past accuracy of each model.


```{r}
#| label: scenario-chart
#| out.width: "100%"
#| fig.width: 11
#| fig.height: 8
params$performance_plot
```

The following table contain the values for the above charts:

```{r}
#| label: prediction-data
#| results: 'asis'
#| ft.align: 'left'


set_flextable_defaults(
  font.size = 8,
  background.color = "#EFEFEF"
)

prediction_table_function <- function(prediction_data) {
  # browser()
  caption_title <- names(prediction_data[1])
  prediction_data <- prediction_data[[1]]
  tbl <- prediction_data |> 
    dplyr::select(
      Year = "year", 
      "value",
      "value_type"
    ) |> 
    tidyr::pivot_wider(
      names_from = value_type,
      values_from = value
    ) |> 
    flextable::flextable() |>  
    
    flextable::set_table_properties(layout = "autofit") |> 
    flextable::set_caption(
      caption = flextable::as_paragraph(
        "\nTable showing the effect of different demand and capacity scenarios on the ",
        flextable::as_b(caption_title),
        "."
      )
    ) |> 
    flextable::colformat_int(
      j = "Year",
      big.mark = ""
    ) |> 
    flextable::colformat_double(
      j = prediction_data |> 
        dplyr::pull(!!rlang::sym("value_type")) |> 
        unique(),
      digits = 1
    ) 
   
  return(tbl)
}

tbls <- split(
  params$prediction_data,
  params$prediction_data$metric
) |> 
  purrr::lmap(
    prediction_table_function
  ) |> 
  purrr::walk(
    flextable::flextable_to_rmd
  )

```

## Limitations

There are limitations with this approach and it is recommended to use this information in combination with other information sources. The main limitation is the availability of data combined with the data driven approach. There may not be related, publicly available information for a performance metric. The model may, therefore, end up either selecting other unrelated metrics to determine its prediction, or even base the prediction largely on the previous value for that performance metric.
